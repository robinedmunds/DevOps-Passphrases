# DevOps Passphrases

## Overview

A simple passphrase generating web app demonstrating modern dev practices: -

1. **Microservices**: the frontend and backend are developed as separate modules
2. **RESTful API**: the backend is a simple web API built with **Python/Django**
3. SPA: the frontend is a **Single-page web app** built on **React/Gatsby**
4. Modules are packages as **Docker** images for portability and scalability
5. ...

## Issues

1. CLI passphrase generating dependency is not cloned automatically from repo.
   1. `cd DevOps-Passphrases/backend/diceware_api`
   2. `git clone https://github.com/robinedmunds/Command-line-Passphrase-Generator.git business`
